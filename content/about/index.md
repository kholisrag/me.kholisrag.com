In the past, present, and perhaps even the future, I firmly think that humankind evolves.
As do I, Kholis Respati Agum Gumelar, or `kholis` as you may call me.

I had believe that until this point of my life journey. I had passionate, self-motivated, curiosity on IT Server World, from On-Premise to Public Cloud environment.

Most lately, I developed a keen interest in architecting complex cloud infrastructure and fully automating it from scratch.

I received confidence for my career path on:

Initiate, Design, Architect, and Deep Technical Implementation of various Cloud Infrastructure issues, including Edge Case + Complex Problems, Scaling and Growing, and Early Adoption.
From Observability and Monitoring, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Cloud Infrastructure Architecting, Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and Developer Experience for debugging + troubleshooting.
