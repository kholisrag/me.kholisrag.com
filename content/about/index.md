Humanity has undoubtedly evolved throughout history, the present, and possibly into the future.
I, Kholis Respati Agum Gumelar, also go by the name 'kholis', felt the evolution too.

I had held that conviction until this juncture in my life. I'm enthusiastic, self-driven, and inquisitive regarding the IT server world, encompassing both On-Premise and Public Cloud (AWS, GCP) environments.

I have recently developed an interest in the design, implementation and full automation of complex infrastructure both On-Premise and Public Cloud.

I obtained reassurance concerning my career trajectory through:

Propose, develop, architect, and execute comprehensive technical implementation of varying cloud infrastructure challenges, including edge cases and complex problems, scaling and expansion, and early adoption.

I have a strong background in architecting cloud infrastructure, infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), debugging and troubleshooting, observing and monitoring, and enhancing the developer experience. Furthermore, I have refined my abilities to optimize cloud infrastructure with regards to performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby guaranteeing the efficient utilization of resources. In addition, I possess prior experience working in conjunction with cross-functional groups to ascertain specifications and offer technical direction, thereby guaranteeing the smooth incorporation of proposed solutions into existing systems.
