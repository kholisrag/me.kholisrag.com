# SOPS + Age a Perfect Twin Brothers for Cost Effective Secret Management

## Background

When I moved to my current company, I was shocked and a bit irritated by the current condition in the infrastructure side.
The infrastructure was not well-organized and documented, there is no Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that I love so much.

I started to introduce and initiate the IaC, and in the process I found that I need to manage the secrets. At first, I want to use GCP Secret Manager / GCP KMS, like what I know in AWS, we can use AWS Parameter Store / AWS KMS to do encryption and storing secrets but it's not cost effective at current scale and condition, we faced.

Racking my brain, when I on the progress of initiating and migrating some of our live Infrastructure to IaC, I found problem that I need to store secrets in git. reading here and there, I stumpled to [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops), that well integrated with [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/). As [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) have [sops_decrypt_file](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file) built in function. The later question that race in my mind is, what next tools I can use for the encryption part. As I mentioned, obiviously I will skip [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), [GCP KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management), and [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), since they need additional cost. So what left is [gpg](https://www.gnupg.org/) or [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). Quick comparison, [gpg](https://www.gnupg.org/) is a bit complex and [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is simple, easy to use, and maybe less computing resources needed, my opinionated hypothesis (not yet proven by data), as I stumbled As I found [Age vs GPG #432](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions/432). Other than that we don't need beautiful exchange feature in GPG like what terraform aws provider does in [pgp_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_access_key#pgp_key) with [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/). So here its goes, I choose [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for the secrets data encryption before storing it in git.

## How To

> Notes:

In this chance, I will focus on how to integreate [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt data then we can store it in git, and decrypt it when we need it.

1. First we need to install [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)

```bash
brew install sops

brew install age
```

2. Check if the installation is successful

```bash
$ sops --version
sops 3.8.1 (latest)
$ age --version
v1.1.1
$ age-keygen --version
v1.1.1
```

4. After that, we need to generate the key for age.
