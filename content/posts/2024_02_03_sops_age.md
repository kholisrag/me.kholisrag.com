# SOPS + Age a Perfect Twin Brothers for Cost Effective Secret Management in Git

## Background

When I moved to my current company, I was shocked and a bit irritated by the current condition in the infrastructure side.
The infrastructure was not well-organized and documented, there is no Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that I love so much.

I started to introduce and initiate the IaC, and in the process I found that I need to manage the secrets. At first, I want to use GCP Secret Manager / GCP KMS, like what I know in AWS, we can use AWS Parameter Store / AWS KMS to do encryption and storing secrets but it's not cost effective at current scale and condition, we faced.

Racking my brain, when I on the progress of initiating and migrating some of our live Infrastructure to IaC, I found problem that I need to store secrets in git. reading here and there, I stumpled to [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops), that well integrated with [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/). As [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) have [sops_decrypt_file](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/built-in-functions/#sops_decrypt_file) built in function. The later question that race in my mind is, what next tools I can use for the encryption part. As I mentioned, obiviously I will skip [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), [GCP KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management), and [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), since they need additional cost. So what left is [gpg](https://www.gnupg.org/) or [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). Quick comparison, [gpg](https://www.gnupg.org/) is a bit complex and [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is simple, easy to use, and maybe less computing resources needed, my opinionated hypothesis (not yet proven by data), as I stumbled As I found [Age vs GPG #432](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/discussions/432). Other than that we don't need beautiful exchange feature in GPG like what terraform aws provider does in [pgp_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_access_key#pgp_key) with [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/). So here its goes, I choose [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for the secrets data encryption before storing it in git.

## How To

{{< admonition note "Notes" true >}}
I use macOS, so the command and the way I do it, maybe different with other OS. but you can refer to the official document for other OS.
{{< /admonition >}}

In this chance, I will focus on how to integreate [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt data then we can store it in git, and decrypt it when we need it.

1. First we need to install [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)

```bash
brew install sops
brew install age

```

2. Check if the installation is successful

```bash
$ sops --version
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}
sops 3.8.1 (latest)
{{< /admonition >}}

```bash
age --version
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}
v1.1.1
{{< /admonition >}}

```bash
age-keygen --version
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}
v1.1.1
{{< /admonition >}}

4. After that, we need to generate age key pair, and let us check the content

```bash
age-keygen -o keys.txt
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}
Public key: age19z2w4gkykg5naumux8l50anh8veav5sk0wl4lmjx9gjggmrc74uq3w92uv
{{< /admonition >}}

```bash
cat keys.txt
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}

```txt
# created: 2024-02-07T19:44:54+07:00
# public key: age19z2w4gkykg5naumux8l50anh8veav5sk0wl4lmjx9gjggmrc74uq3w92uv
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1Y0HRFPHJMKEFQ2249ZR3LZMJ295J5W3VE9QYDTASWW7H9JT9LTAS2QQ88N
```

As you see the key pair will be :

- The Public key is `age19z2w4gkykg5naumux8l50anh8veav5sk0wl4lmjx9gjggmrc74uq3w92uv`

- The Private key is `AGE-SECRET-KEY-1Y0HRFPHJMKEFQ2249ZR3LZMJ295J5W3VE9QYDTASWW7H9JT9LTAS2QQ88N`

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition warning "Warning" false >}}
Please keep the private key in a safe place, as it's the only way to decrypt the data encrypted with the public key.
{{< /admonition >}}

4. Configure SOPS to use Age

```bash
# configure sops to use our private key ~/keys.txt
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/keys.txt
# configure sops to use our public key / recipient
export SOPS_AGE_RECIPIENTS=age19z2w4gkykg5naumux8l50anh8veav5sk0wl4lmjx9gjggmrc74uq3w92uv
```

5. Now we can start to encrypt the data with SOPS and Age

lets say we have a file `secrets.yaml` with the following content

```yaml
secrets:
  db:
    username: admin
    password: Str0nGP@ssw0rd
  api:
    key: 1234567890987654321
```

we can encrypt the file with the following command

```bash
sops --encrypt secrets.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml
```

6. Check the encrypted file

```bash
cat secrets.enc.yaml
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}

```yaml
secrets:
  db:
    username: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:02kaPac=,iv:1Ixg5HTyMs/lIAAD1CPKB/DMQ9dGFB/zjtkCcn+j2ZA=,tag:2sBjBrxTZF4hXvxOAwnUOg==,type:str]
    password: ENC[AES256_GCM,data:LftsUgh3Kr3hbF4UZkE=,iv:UCNXF47VD2szy9WEd4X5rUbvJTlxh8WaK16W5f9FYBc=,tag:TTlY83P1qllLrq1OjgJxlg==,type:str]
  api:

sops:
  kms: []
  gcp_kms: []
  azure_kv: []
  hc_vault: []
  age:
    - recipient: age19z2w4gkykg5naumux8l50anh8veav5sk0wl4lmjx9gjggmrc74uq3w92uv
      enc: |

  pgp: []
  unencrypted_suffix: _unencrypted
  version: 3.8.1
```

{{< /admonition >}}

7. Next we can try to decrypt the file

```bash
sops --decrypt secrets.enc.yaml > secrets.test.yaml
```

{{< admonition note "Example Output" false >}}

```yaml
secrets:
  db:
    username: admin
    password: Str0nGP@ssw0rd
  api:
    key: 1234567890987654321
```

{{< /admonition >}}

8. Now we can commit the `secrets.enc.yaml` to git, and when we need to decrypt it, we can use the `sops` command to decrypt it.

## Conclusion

In this post, I have shown how to integrate [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
to encrypt data then we can store it in git, and decrypt it when we need it. This is a cost effective way to manage secrets in git, and it's easy to use. As far as I know, this [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is well integrated with [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/), and [argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en) using [helm-secrets](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/ArgoCD-Integration#using-age-1). So it's a good choice for managing secrets in git for your Infrastructure as Code (IaC), GitOps with ArgoCD, and maybe other use cases.
